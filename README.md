# QA-Automation-Demo

Developer repository demo

A simple HTML page for practicing QA automation testing

GitHub Actions workflow (`trigger-ci.yml`) that triggers CI processes in a separate automation repository when changes are pushed to main

The project likely serves as a test target for automation scripts located in another repository

The project seems designed to simulate a development repository that integrates with external QA automation tools, possibly for training or demonstration purposes.
