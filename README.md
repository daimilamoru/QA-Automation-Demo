# QA-Automation-Demo

Project Summary
This is a QA-Automation-Demo project designed for CI/CD training purposes. It consists of:

Simple HTML pages ( index.html and  index2.html) that serve as targets for QA automation testing

A GitHub Actions workflow ( trigger-ci.yml) that triggers CI processes in a separate automation repository when changes are pushed to the main branch

The project integrates with external QA automation tools in another repository (daimilamoru/MyProjectWithCICD)

The HTML pages contain basic content with links to Swag Labs, likely used for demonstration and practice of automation testing techniques.
